Teacher Assistance - Student Performance Prediction
This project analyzes a dataset of teaching evaluations to predict student performance. It includes data loading, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, modeling, and evaluation.

📁 Project Structure
Notebook: teacher assistance.ipynb – full analysis and modeling workflow.

Data: tae.csv – includes teaching assistant evaluations and student performance labels.

Reference: Project details from PRCP-1026-Teaching Assistance.docx.pdf.

🎯 Objective
Predict the quality of student performance based on:

Instructor details

Course information

Teaching methodology

Classroom environment

🗃️ Dataset Overview
The dataset includes the following features:

Instructor and course identifiers

Teaching assistant qualifications

Class size, attendance, and related factors

Performance labels (categorical target variable)

🔍 Key Steps
1. Data Loading and Inspection
Load CSV using pandas.

Inspect data types, summary statistics, and potential issues.

2. Data Cleaning
Handle missing values and duplicates.

Remove or handle outliers as needed.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualize distributions and relationships.

Analyze categorical and numerical features.

Study correlation between features and student performance.

4. Feature Engineering
Encode categorical variables.

Create new features to improve model performance.

5. Modeling
Train several classifiers (e.g., Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression).

Evaluate performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score.

Perform hyperparameter tuning for optimization.

📈 Results
Identified key predictors of performance such as instructor, class type, and teaching method.

Selected the best model based on cross-validation and metric performance.
